# Employee Exit Surveys: Who Leaves due to Dissatisfaction?

In this expanded DataQuest assignment, I assessed the exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)}) and the [Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_and_further_education) in Queensland, Australia. The TAFE exit survey can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).

I investigated the following questions:
- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
- How does age and career stage together affect resigning due to dissatisfaction?
- Does position or institute worked at affect this?

In order to answer these questions, I cleaned and analyzed the data.

## Potential Future Directions

- Why do different groups leave the company?
- Are there differences in gender in why or how people leave?
- When do people retire? 
- Who gets fired and is there a link with dissatisfaction?
